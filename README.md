## TODO (from person feedback)

### Length / structure

- [ ] **Condense resume from 3 pages to 2 pages**
  - [ ] Move most details into **most recent work** and/or work you’re **most proud of** and prefer to talk about during interviews
  - [ ] Identify older/less-relevant content that can be trimmed or merged

### Visual / UX design improvements

- [ ] **Consider making the design less “safe” and more aligned with my UI style preferences**
  - [ ] Explore a more distinctive layout/theme (potentially with AI assistance) while staying professional and readable
  - [ ] Make the resume feel like a **well-designed product**: intuitive, clean, emotionally resonant
  - [ ] Ensure it communicates “design experiences”, not only “build interfaces”

- [ ] **Apply “top-tier frontend/design-adjacent resume” layout trends**
  - [ ] Minimalist, modern layout with **generous white space**
  - [ ] Clear visual hierarchy via **typography + spacing** (not only bold)
  - [ ] Subtle, intentional use of **color for emphasis** (not decoration)
  - [ ] Consistent alignment and an **invisible grid-based structure**
  - [ ] Emphasis on readability: **line height**, **font choice**, **contrast**

- [ ] **Fix the major UX issue: blue text reads as hyperlinks**
  - [ ] Revert **all blue text** that is not meant to be clickable to a **non-blue color**
  - [ ] Audit the PDF for any remaining “hyperlink-looking” styling

- [ ] **Optional: request/share the additional AI UX/design advice**
  - [ ] “The AI actually offered even more advice about UX/Design improvements, can share that if you're interested” (keep as-is)

### Content improvements (skills, leadership, collaboration)

- [ ] **Re-evaluate “8 years of HTML and CSS experience” placement**
  - [ ] Decide whether to remove it as “implied / not super important anymore”
  - [ ] If kept, move it out of the most prominent/top section or justify why it belongs there

- [ ] **Add / highlight team lead experience**
  - [ ] Include **duration** of team lead experience
  - [ ] Include **scope/size of area** you were responsible for (team size? product area? impact?)

- [ ] **Update DMIS experience section**
  - [ ] Mention **team leadership experience** in DMIS
  - [ ] Consider adding “collaborated closely with **design** and **backend**” if accurate (signals strong teamwork)

- [ ] **Clarify “Scores and More” collaboration**
  - [ ] Specify whether you worked with a **team / other people**
  - [ ] If yes, describe **capacity/role** (ownership, cross-functional work, leadership, etc.) if it’s worth including

- [ ] **Strengthen TypeScript / modernization bullet**
  - [ ] Keep/clarify “**TypeScript coverage of 99%**” (ensure it’s credible and clearly scoped)
  - [ ] Add: “**used AI to complete a complex React upgrade 18 → 19**” (as suggested) to show modern tooling usage (if accurate)

- [ ] **Add work-mode context (remote/hybrid/in-person)**
  - [ ] Mention roughly whether experience includes **remote**, **hybrid**, and/or **in-person**
  - [ ] Frame it as “works well in both remote and in-person” where truthful

### Positioning / framing reminders (keep as-is feedback intent)

- [ ] **Design the resume as if it were a product you’re launching**
  - [ ] Treat the resume as your best UX case study; spacing/font/color/layout should reflect design philosophy
